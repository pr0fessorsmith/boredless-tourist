# The Boredless Tourist

## This project consists of one app that will search for an attraction given one location, based on the traveler's interests. 

It is also possible to return more than one attraction based on several interests. Bear in mind that interests must be passed as list, or else the call for 'find_attractions' will return empty.

I am **not** the creator of this project, as it was idealized as part of the **Data Science Course** in **CodecademyÂ©**, however I made some changes in the logic according to my experience in debugging.
